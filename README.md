# Basic Qt Quick QML Mobile Application

Qt Creator has removed the ability to create a Qt Quick applicaiton using qmake, forcing us to use cmake. And while I see that it will one day be a superior route to go... It ain't there yet.

So This is a base project from which you create all your QML projects from until Qt gets it right.

# To Start

- Clone this repo.
- Delete the `.git` directory.
- Rename the folder name and the name of the `*pro` file.
- `git init` to start your own version control.
- Fire up Qt Creator and configure the project.

From there, you have your project base like you used to.
Maybe run it in an emulator before you make changes to make sure everything is in place.
